# Quatnum Random

## Basic information
This is simple python library for the purpose of producing radnom numbers from the quatum source. Organization providing source infromation is ANU QRNG through their API. If you use this library on the daily basis or for commercial purpose, I am encouraging you to donate to this people for ther work. Those guys and girls gave tremendous contribution to humanity and moder world by giving this information for free.

## Why Quantum Random
Every programming language(at least that I know of) contains feature for generating random numbers. Though, those numbers are not random in real meaning of the word. Random numbers that you can generate through C, Java, Pyton... are generated using speciffic algorithm. In other word, in this way generated numbers are calculated, what makes them not random, but rather, random from human perspective.

Only way to get reall random numbers using modern day technology is from quantum source. From web site of `ANU QRNG` you can find out more, how phisics behind all this works.
